ðŸ§  Python Churn Prediction Model

This machine learning project predicts customer churn using a telecom dataset. It includes data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, and performance evaluation using scikit-learn.

ðŸ“Œ Features
- Cleaned and encoded categorical and numeric data
- Feature correlation and visualization with heatmaps
- Built and evaluated a Random Forest classifier
- Output includes classification report and confusion matrix

 ðŸ”§ Tools Used
- Python
- pandas, NumPy
- scikit-learn
- seaborn, matplotlib

 ðŸ§  Key Insights
- Contract type and tenure are strong predictors of churn
- The model achieved ~85% accuracy on test data
- Churn is highest among customers with short tenure and high monthly charges
